    "bio": "Hey there, I'm Chris Thompson. I've been coding for a little over a year now. As a Frontend developer I've worked as an intern with a SaaS startup, currently working with an NFT startup company building their front-end, and built out my own series of robust react apps. Along the journey I realised my passion for making an impact on the world through the engaging skill of software development. I decided to commit myself 100% to this craft after having such an empowering experience starting from ground zero and getting to the point where I could build out my own projects",
